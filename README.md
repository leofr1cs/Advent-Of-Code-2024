# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code challenges for the year 2024. Each day I will solve a new puzzle and record my solution in a Python script for that day.

## Introduction

Advent of Code is an annual event that offers a series of small programming puzzles. The challenge spans 25 days, and I will be solving one puzzle each day in Python. This repository contains my solutions, along with helpful comments and explanations. The code for each day is stored in a separate Python file.

I am also making use of tools like `aocd` to fetch puzzle input data directly from the Advent of Code website.

## Features

Some cool features of this repository:
- **Code for each day**: All solutions are stored in individual Python files (`day1.py`, `day2.py`, etc.).
- **Helper Functions**: I've added reusable helper functions like grid movement vectors, combinations, and permutations to speed up problem-solving.
- **Input Handling**: The `aocd` library is used to fetch input data for each challenge directly from the Advent of Code website.
- **Markdown Features**: This `README.md` file demonstrates some powerful markdown features.

### Markdown Features Demonstration

Here are some markdown features I use in my repository:

#### 1. **Code Blocks**

```python
# Example Python Code Block
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, world!")
